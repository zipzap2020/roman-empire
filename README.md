# roman-empire
This project was created to share my work with anyone interested in the history of the Roman Empire.
The main goal of publishing this website on GitHub is to make the content publicly available and accessible to everyone.

I also welcome contributions, suggestions, and corrections from people who have knowledge of the Roman Empire, especially regarding historical accuracy and additional information that could improve the project.
