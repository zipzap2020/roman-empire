            <h1>Architecture of the Eastern Roman Empire</h1>

<section>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    The architecture of the Eastern Roman Empire, often called Byzantine architecture, combined <strong>classical Roman techniques</strong> with new innovations that reflected the empire's spiritual and political identity. Buildings were designed to inspire awe, convey imperial power, and serve both civic and religious purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    From majestic churches to fortified palaces, the architecture of Byzantium was a visual representation of the empire’s strength, creativity, and devotion, emphasizing <strong>light, space, and symbolic meaning</strong> in every structure.

  <h3>Churches and Religious Structures</h3>
  <p>
    Religious architecture was at the core of Byzantine design. <strong>Hagia Sophia</strong> in Constantinople epitomized the empire’s ambition, combining a massive dome with intricate mosaics and elegant arches. Such churches were not only places of worship but also statements of imperial glory and divine order.
  </p>
  <p>
    Byzantine churches often featured <strong>central domes</strong>, <strong>pendentives</strong>, and lavish decoration, aiming to create a sense of <strong>heavenly space</strong> on earth. These innovations influenced Orthodox church architecture for centuries.

    Due to frequent invasions, the Eastern Romans developed <strong>advanced fortifications</strong>. City walls, such as the famous <strong>Theodosian Walls of Constantinople</strong>, combined multiple layers of defense with towers and strategic gates, demonstrating both military ingenuity and architectural sophistication.
  </p>
  <p>
    These structures were not only practical but also symbolic, projecting <strong>strength and resilience</strong> to allies and enemies alike.
