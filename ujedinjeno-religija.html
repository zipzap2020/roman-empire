    Alongside official worship, foreign and mystery religions entered the empire via trade and military channels. Cults such as <strong>Isis</strong>, <strong>Mithras</strong>, and <strong>Cybele</strong> offered personal salvation, initiation rituals, and emotional spirituality.

  <h3>The Rise of Christianity</h3>

    By the third and fourth centuries CE, Christianity began to spread widely. Initially persecuted, Christians eventually received imperial recognition under Constantine, marking a transformation in the empire’s religious landscape.
  </p>

    Cities such as <strong>Rome</strong>, <strong>Antioch</strong>, and <strong>Alexandria</strong> became early centers of Christian life, paving the way for the shift from polytheism to monotheism and reshaping the spiritual culture of the Roman world.

    Even as Christianity rose to prominence, many Roman traditions endured, creating a bridge between ancient polytheistic practices and the spiritual foundations of the medieval world.
