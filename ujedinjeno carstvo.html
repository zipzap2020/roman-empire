            <h2> The Early Roman Empire</h2>
      <p>In the cradle of myth, upon the banks of the Tiber, two brothers — <strong>Romulus</strong> and <strong>Remus</strong> — rose from the wild heart of destiny. Nursed by a she-wolf, they dreamed of a city that would rule the ages. When brother turned against brother, <strong>Romulus</strong> stood alone, and from his name the eternal city was born — <strong>Rome</strong>, <strong>753 BCE</strong>.</p>

<p>From shepherds and farmers grew a kingdom, and from kings a <strong>Republic</strong> — a republic of laws, forged in courage and ambition. Senators debated beneath the gods’ gaze while soldiers conquered the world. The legions crossed seas and mountains, carrying the Roman standard to the edges of the known world.</p>

<p>Then came the time of transformation. Civil wars tore the Republic apart until <strong>Gaius Octavius</strong>, known as <strong>Augustus</strong>, gathered its broken soul and crowned himself the first emperor. Thus dawned the <strong>Early Roman Empire</strong>, an age of order, art, and dominion. Under <strong>Augustus</strong>, the <strong>Pax Romana</strong> — the Roman Peace — stretched across three continents.</p>

<p>Within its borders lived a vast mosaic of peoples: <strong>Latins, Greeks, Egyptians, Syrians, Gauls, Iberians, Africans, Jews, Thracians</strong>, and countless others. Rome was not one nation but the world itself, bound by law, roads, and language. <strong>Latin</strong> ruled the West, <strong>Greek</strong> the East — together they formed the double heartbeat of civilization. The city’s streets filled with poets, merchants, slaves, magistrates, and philosophers — all subjects beneath the eagle’s wings. Roman law, architecture, engineering, and literature spread across provinces; aqueducts carried water, roads carried commerce, and public baths carried the hum of daily life.</p>

<p>Generations of emperors rose — <strong>Tiberius, Claudius, Nero</strong> — builders and tyrants alike. From <strong>Trajan’s</strong> conquests to <strong>Hadrian’s</strong> walls, from <strong>Marcus Aurelius’</strong> meditations to the excesses of <strong>Commodus</strong>, Rome flourished and faltered, ever reaching for eternity. Its strengths lay in administration, military discipline, and cultural assimilation; its strains appeared through corruption, succession crises, and economic pressures. The empire’s institutions evolved: the army professionalized, imperial bureaucracy expanded, and provincial elites were gradually integrated into Roman structures of power. Religion and loyalty shifted as well: the old polytheistic rites competed — and later intertwined — with newer beliefs.</p>

<p>As centuries turned, shadows grew. Corruption crept where virtue once stood, and the legions that once guarded Rome sometimes fractured under competing loyalties. <strong>Diocletian</strong> undertook sweeping reforms and formally divided imperial administration into more manageable units; he created the <strong>Tetrarchy</strong> to stabilize rule. Yet division sowed seeds of separation. Meanwhile, <strong>Christianity</strong> rose from persecution to prominence and reshaped the empire’s spiritual center — shifting identity and policy. Under <strong>Theodosius the Great</strong>, Christianity became central to imperial life and policy; pagan cults lost official protection.</p>

<p>When <strong>Theodosius I</strong> died in <strong>395 CE</strong>, the Roman world was divided between East and West, a political fracture that marked the end of a united Roman Empire. The western provinces entered a long twilight, while the eastern half — later called the <strong>Byzantine Empire</strong> — carried Rome’s legacy forward in new forms. Yet the dream of <strong>Rome</strong> did not die. Her laws still breathe in modern justice, her roads still mark the earth, and her languages still echo in our speech. From <strong>Romulus</strong> to <strong>Theodosius</strong>, from myth to empire, <strong>Rome</strong> was not merely a city — she was eternity made flesh: an influence that shaped law, faith, language and statecraft for millennia.</p>
